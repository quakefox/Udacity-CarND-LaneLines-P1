## Overview
---

This project of finding lanes is the first homework of the Udacity Selfdriving Car Nanodegree program. The code will detect lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV.  


# The Project Setup
Step 1: Set up the [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md).

Step 2: Git clone the repository to your local machine

Steo 3: Open the code in a Jupyter Notebook

To start Jupyter in your browser, use terminal to navigate to your project directory and then run the following command at the terminal prompt (be sure you've activated your Python 3 carnd-term1 environment):

> jupyter notebook

A browser window will appear showing the contents of the current directory. Click on the file called "Lane-Finding-Project.ipynb". Another browser window will appear displaying the notebook. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the project.

The deliverable includes two files:
1. P1.ipynb - project code
2. writeup.md - project summary and reflections

Please refer to the writeup_LaneLines.md for steps of the lane finding pipelines and P1.ipynb for implementation details.
